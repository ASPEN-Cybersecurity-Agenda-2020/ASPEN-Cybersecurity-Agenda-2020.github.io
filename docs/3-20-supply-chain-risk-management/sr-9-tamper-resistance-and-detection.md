## SR-9 TAMPER RESISTANCE AND DETECTION

<ins>Control</ins>: Implement a tamper protection program for the system, system component, or system service.

<ins>Discussion</ins>: Anti-tamper technologies, tools, and techniques provide a level of protection for systems, system components, and services against many threats, including reverse engineering, modification, and substitution. Strong identification combined with tamper resistance and/or tamper detection is essential to protecting systems and components during distribution and when in use.

<ins>Related Controls</ins>: PE-3 , PM-30 , SA-15 , SI-4 , SI-7 , SR-3 , SR-4 , SR-5 , SR-10 , SR-11.

<ins>Control Enhancements</ins>:
   
* (1) TAMPER RESISTANCE AND DETECTION / MULTIPLE STAGES OF SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE<br>
**Employ anti-tamper technologies, tools, and techniques throughout the system development life cycle.**

    <ins>Discussion</ins>: The system development life cycle includes research and development, design, manufacturing, acquisition, delivery, integration, operations and maintenance, and disposal. Organizations use a combination of hardware and software techniques for tamper resistance and detection. Organizations use obfuscation and self-checking to make reverse engineering and modifications more difficult, time-consuming, and expensive for adversaries. The customization of systems and system components can make substitutions easier to detect and therefore limit damage.

    <ins>Related Controls</ins>: SA-3.
