## SA-23 SPECIALIZATION

<ins>Control</ins>: Employ [ _Selection (one or more): design modification, augmentation, reconfiguration_ ] on [ _Assignment: organization-defined systems or system components_ ] supporting mission essential services or functions to increase the trustworthiness in those systems or components.
      
<ins>Discussion</ins>: It is often necessary for a system or system component that supports mission- essential services or functions to be enhanced to maximize the trustworthiness of the resource. Sometimes this enhancement is done at the design level. In other instances, it is done post- design, either through modifications of the system in question or by augmenting the system with additional components. For example, supplemental authentication or non-repudiation functions may be added to the system to enhance the identity of critical resources to other resources that depend on the organization-defined resources.
