The Aspen Cybersecurity Group is a forum for a diverse range of voices, and this report draws on the advice and expertise of a variety of outside partners and colleagues and across industry, government, and civil society. As with any attempt to distill the collective wisdom of an entire community, our efforts have relied on the counsel of too many individuals to acknowledge here. But we would like to give special thanks to people and organizations who graciously volunteered their time to reflect on the challenges ahead of us and help craft a path toward progress.  

This report was compiled, managed, and written by David Forscey, with assistance from the entire team at Aspen Digital, including Savilla Pitt, Garrett Graff, Beth Semel, Carner Derron, and Vivian Schiller. Special thanks to Betsy Cooper, Meha Ahluwalia, Mai Sistla, Dominique Harrison, and Kristine Gloria for their contributions on some of the report’s most important sections.
