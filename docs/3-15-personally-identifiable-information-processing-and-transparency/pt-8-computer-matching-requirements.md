<ins>Discussion</ins>: The [PRIVACT] establishes requirements for federal and non-federal agencies if they
engage in a matching program. In general, a matching program is a computerized comparison of
records from two or more automated [PRIVACT] systems of records or an automated system of
records and automated records maintained by a non-federal agency (or agent thereof). A
matching program either pertains to federal benefit programs or federal personnel or payroll
records. A federal benefit match is performed to determine or verify eligibility for payments
under federal benefit programs or to recoup payments or delinquent debts under federal benefit
programs. A matching program involves not just the matching activity itself but also the
investigative follow-up and ultimate action, if any.
