## PE-13 FIRE PROTECTION

<ins>Control</ins>: Employ and maintain fire detection and suppression systems that are supported by an independent energy source.

<ins>Discussion</ins>: The provision of fire detection and suppression systems applies primarily to organizational facilities that contain concentrations of system resources, including data centers, server rooms, and mainframe computer rooms. Fire detection and suppression systems that may require an independent energy source include sprinkler systems and smoke detectors. An independent energy source is an energy source, such as a microgrid, that is separate, or can be separated, from the energy sources providing power for the other parts of the facility.

<ins>Related Controls</ins>: AT-3.

<ins>Control Enhancements</ins>:

* (1) FIRE PROTECTION / DETECTION SYSTEMS – AUTOMATIC ACTIVATION AND NOTIFICATION<br>
**Employ fire detection systems that activate automatically and notify [ _Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles_ ] and [ _Assignment: organization-defined emergency responders_ ] in the event of a fire.**

    <ins>Discussion</ins>: Organizations can identify personnel, roles, and emergency responders if individuals on the notification list need to have access authorizations or clearances (e.g., to enter to facilities where access is restricted due to the classification or impact level of information within the facility). Notification mechanisms may require independent energy sources to ensure that the notification capability is not adversely affected by the fire.

    <ins>Related Controls</ins>: None.

* (2) FIRE PROTECTION / SUPPRESSION SYSTEMS – AUTOMATIC ACTIVATION AND NOTIFICATION<br>
    * **(a) Employ fire suppression systems that activate automatically and notify [ _Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles_ ] and [ _Assignment: organization-defined emergency responders_ ]; and**
    * **(b) Employ an automatic fire suppression capability when the facility is not staffed on a continuous basis.**

    <ins>Discussion</ins>: Organizations can identify specific personnel, roles, and emergency responders if individuals on the notification list need to have appropriate access authorizations and/or clearances (e.g., to enter to facilities where access is restricted due to the impact level or classification of information within the facility). Notification mechanisms may require independent energy sources to ensure that the notification capability is not adversely affected by the fire.

    <ins>Related Controls</ins>: None.

* (3) FIRE PROTECTION / AUTOMATIC FIRE SUPPRESSION<br>
[Withdrawn: Incorporated into PE-13(2).]

* (4) FIRE PROTECTION / INSPECTIONS<br>
**Ensure that the facility undergoes [ _Assignment: organization-defined frequency_ ] fire protection inspections by authorized and qualified inspectors and identified deficiencies are resolved within [ _Assignment: organization-defined time period_ ].**

    <ins>Discussion</ins>: Authorized and qualified personnel within the jurisdiction of the organization include state, county, and city fire inspectors and fire marshals. Organizations provide escorts during inspections in situations where the systems that reside within the facilities contain sensitive information.

    <ins>Related Controls</ins>: None.

<ins>References</ins>: None.
