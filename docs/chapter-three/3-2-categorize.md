<sup>74</sup>The RMF _Categorize_ step is a precondition for the selection of security controls. However, for privacy, there are other factors considered by organizations that guide and inform the selection of privacy controls. These factors are described in the RMF _Prepare-System Level_ step, Task P-15.
