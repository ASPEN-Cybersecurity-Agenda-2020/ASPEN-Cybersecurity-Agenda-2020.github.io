### RISK MANAGEMENT ROLES
TASK P-1
{: .fs-4 .label }
Identify and assign individuals to specific roles associated with security and privacy risk management.  
**Potential Inputs:** Organizational security and privacy policies and procedures; organizational charts.  
**Expected Outputs:** Documented Risk Management Framework role assignments.  
**Primary Responsibility:** Head of Agency; Chief Information Officer; Senior Agency Official for Privacy.  
**Supporting Roles:** Authorizing Official or Authorizing Official Designated Representative; Senior Accountable Official for Risk Management or Risk Executive (Function); Senior Agency Information Security Officer.  
**Discussion:** The roles and responsibilities of key participants in risk management processes are described in Appendix D. The roles and responsibilities may include personnel that are internal or external to the organization, as appropriate. Since organizations have different missions, functions, and organizational structures, there may be differences in naming conventions for risk management roles and how specific responsibilities are allocated among organizational personnel (e.g., multiple individuals filling a single role or one individual filling multiple roles). In either situation, the basic risk management functions remain the same. Organizations ensure that there are no conflicts of interest when assigning the same individual to multiple risk management roles. For example, authorizing officials cannot occupy the role of system owner or common control provider for systems or common controls they are authorizing. In addition, combining multiple roles for security and privacy requires care because the two disciplines may require different expertise, and in some circumstances, the priorities may be competing. Some roles may be allocated to a group or an office rather than to an individual, for example, control assessor, risk executive (function), or system administrator.
