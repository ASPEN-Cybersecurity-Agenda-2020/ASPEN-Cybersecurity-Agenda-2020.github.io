**Authority**

```
This publication has been developed by NIST to further its statutory responsibilities under the
Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA), 44 U.S.C. § 3551 et seq. , Public Law
(P.L.) 113-283. NIST is responsible for developing information security standards and guidelines,
including minimum requirements for federal information systems. Such information security
standards and guidelines shall not apply to national security systems without the express
approval of the appropriate federal officials exercising policy authority over such systems. This
guideline is consistent with the requirements of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
Circular A-130.
```
```
Nothing in this publication should be taken to contradict the standards and guidelines made
mandatory and binding on federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory
authority. Nor should these guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing
authorities of the Secretary of Commerce, OMB Director, or any other federal official. This
publication may be used by nongovernmental organizations on a voluntary basis and is not
subject to copyright in the United States. Attribution would, however, be appreciated by NIST.

Certain commercial entities, equipment, or materials may be identified in this document to describe
an experimental procedure or concept adequately. Such identification is not intended to imply
recommendation or endorsement by NIST, nor is it intended to imply that the entities, materials, or
equipment are necessarily the best available for the purpose.
There may be references in this publication to other publications currently under development by
NIST in accordance with its assigned statutory responsibilities. The information in this publication,
including concepts, practices, and methodologies may be used by federal agencies even before the
completion of such companion publications. Thus, until each publication is completed, current
requirements, guidelines, and procedures, where they exist, remain operative. For planning and
transition purposes, federal agencies may wish to closely follow the development of these new
publications by NIST.
Organizations are encouraged to review draft publications during the designated public comment
periods and provide feedback to NIST. Many NIST publications, other than the ones noted above,
are available at https://csrc.nist.gov/publications.

**Reports on Computer Systems Technology**

```
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Information Technology Laboratory
(ITL) promotes the U.S. economy and public welfare by providing technical leadership for the
Nation’s measurement and standards infrastructure. ITL develops tests, test methods, reference
data, proof of concept implementations, and technical analyses to advance the development
and productive use of information technology (IT). ITL’s responsibilities include the development
of management, administrative, technical, and physical standards and guidelines for the cost-
effective security of other than national security-related information in federal information
systems. The Special Publication 800-series reports on ITL’s research, guidelines, and outreach
efforts in information systems security and privacy and its collaborative activities with industry,
government, and academic organizations.

**Abstract**

```
This publication provides a catalog of security and privacy controls for information systems and
organizations to protect organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations,
and the Nation from a diverse set of threats and risks, including hostile attacks, human errors,
natural disasters, structural failures, foreign intelligence entities, and privacy risks. The controls
are flexible and customizable and implemented as part of an organization-wide process to
manage risk. The controls address diverse requirements derived from mission and business
needs, laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Finally,
the consolidated control catalog addresses security and privacy from a functionality perspective
(i.e., the strength of functions and mechanisms provided by the controls) and from an assurance
perspective (i.e., the measure of confidence in the security or privacy capability provided by the
controls). Addressing functionality and assurance helps to ensure that information technology
products and the systems that rely on those products are sufficiently trustworthy.
